**Abstract**

This project analyzes the relationship between movie ratings, popularity, revenue, and genres by integrating data from IMDB and TMDB for films released between 2006 and 2016. 
Data were acquired from a Kaggle IMDB dataset and the TMDB API, then standardized, cleaned, and merged using a composite key based on movie title and release year. 
Extensive data profiling and quality improvement techniques were applied to address missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies, resulting in a unified and enriched dataset. 
The final dataset was stored in a MySQL database to enable efficient querying and structured analysis. 
Through a series of SQL queries, the study examines correlations between popularity, ratings, metascores, and revenue, as well as the impact of genres on critical reception. 
Results show a strong correlation between popularity and revenue, while audience ratings and critical scores do not always align with commercial success. 
Genre-based analysis indicates that animation, biography, and historical films achieve higher average metascores, whereas action, romance, and fantasy films tend to score lower. 
Overall, the project demonstrates how data integration, quality management, and relational databases can be effectively combined to extract meaningful insights from heterogeneous data sources.
